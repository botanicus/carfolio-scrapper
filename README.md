# Usage

```
# Download the code.
git clone https://gist.github.com/024075a0046a43c683b6.git scrapper

# Fetch dependencies.
# This assumes you have bundler installed.
# If not, run gem install bundler.
bundle

# Run the scrapper.
bundle exec ./scrapper/scrapper.rb
```

After you run the scrapper, you should find a new directory called `specs` with bunch of `csv` files.
